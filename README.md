#java-sockets 

Write, using sockets, a server that supports multiple commands and a client that supports sending them. Each request's length should be four bytes precisely. The server's output's length should vary according to the command.  Make a textual user interface that enables command input. These are the commands that should be supported by the server and the client -
 
TIME - Return the current time on the server
WHORU - Return a string representation containing the name (The name can be any name you would like) 
RAND - Return a random number between 1 to 10 
Exit - The server should close the connection with the client


Background materials -

A good book about computer networks, written in Hebrew.
Even though its for learning networks through python, chapters 1, 2 (without the exercises) and 3 will give you a good background
tps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBpuvPW0aHa7mKdn_k9SPKO A playlist of a very good instructor explaining computer networks, watch videos 1-26, 37 and 38 as an alternative for reading the book!
